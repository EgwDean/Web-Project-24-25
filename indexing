Determining whether a table in SQL needs indexing when querying involves analyzing the performance of your queries and identifying potential bottlenecks. Here's how you can evaluate this:

1. Analyze Query Performance
Use EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE for more detailed output) to understand how the database executes your query. This command provides information about:

- Whether the query uses indexes.
- The number of rows scanned.
- The type of join operations performed.

Example:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';

Look for:

Full Table Scans: If the database scans the entire table, it might indicate a missing index.
Rows Examined: A high number of rows examined compared to the result size suggests inefficient access patterns.
